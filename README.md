FLINGO Privacy
Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This Privacy Policy tells you about the information we gather from users and how we handle, store, protect, or share it when you use our Service. While the full document has all the details, here's a simple summary.

Your privacy matters to us. We value privacy and are open about our rules.
We don't trade your information.
We only keep necessary data. We only store what's necessary for the Service to work.
You manage your information. You can ask for a copy of your data or request its deletion at any time.
Data we collect includes:
Server: We store server informations like: Server id for premium system
Voice Channel ID: We store Voice Channel ID for 247 command.
User ID: We store user ID for premium system and no-prefix system
Duration of Data Storage:
Data is retained for as long as necessary for the Service to operate or until a deletion request is made. When the bot is removed from a server, it stops collecting data from that server.

Data Disclosure:
Your data is important to us. We do not share it with third parties except for the services listed below:-

Online Database:
We use MongoDB for storing FLINGO data, ensuring secure and reliable data management for our users. For more information, please refer to MongoDB's Privacy Policy.

Data Deletion: How to Make It Happen
If you want your user data deleted, you can reach out to us in our support Discord server and messaging a developer with your Discord User ID. Keep in mind, deleting certain data might make some or all features of the Service unavailable. And if you ask to delete premium information, your servers might get deactivated without a refund. You can request data deletion once every 30 days. Contact Us for Support.
